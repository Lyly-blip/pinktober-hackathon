    <h1>1. Drop off dinner (or breakfast or lunch)!</h1>
    <p > Your friend's appetite and taste preferences may be affected by breast cancer treatment, so ask if she's following a special diet - or has a taste for ahything in particular. Often, large heavy meals aren't
        appealing during treatment. Small, nutrient-dense snacks or "mini meals" are typically more manageable. Think: apples & peanut butter, cheese & crackers, hummus & carrots or classic broth-based soups like chicken noodle or minestrone.</p>

    <h1>2. Help with the housework. </h1>
    <p > The laundry still needs to be done. The hardwood floors shout "mop me!" The dishes pile up in the sink. You know how hard it is to keep up on a daily basis in good health.
        Why not offer even an hour of your time while she rests? </p>
</div>
<div class ="quatre">
    <h1>3. Or don't forget the yard...  </h1>
    <p >Cutting the lawn, raking the leaves or shoveling the snow. Even if these chores are usually done by her hubby - it's a huge help. You can bet her better half also has more on his plate than usual, both logistically and emo-tionally </p>
</div>
<div class ="cinq">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-person-breastfeeding" style="color: #cf569c;"></i>
    <h1>4. Babysit or help with homework.</h1>
    <p > If your friend has young children, ask if you can lend a hand. While routines such as childcare or helping study for a math exam can be comforting at times, they can also get overwhelming. Offer it as an option to show you care.</p>
</div>
<div class ="six">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-medical" style="color: #eac49a;"></i></p>
    <h1>5. Attend a support group or shemo treatment together.</h1>
    <p > Maybe she's shy about going to a support group alone. Maybe driving herself to chemotherapy and sitting there alone for hours makes her mind numb and she'd like some company. Ask and see.  </p>
</div>
<div class ="sept">
   <P><i class="fa-solid fa-vest-patches" style="color: #cf569c;"></i></p>
    <h1>6. If a life preserver is needed throw one.</h1>
    <p >If your friend does not have insurance, or is otherwise struggling to pay her medical bills, why not start a fundraiser?
        There are many options, including those on-line, to help ease her burden.</p>
</div>
<div class ="huit">
    <P><i class="fa-solid fa-user-group" style="color: #eac49a;"></i></P>
    <h1>7. Continue being her friend!</h1>
    <p >If you've been there through thick and thin, don't stop now. Communicate from the get-go and throughout her entire breast cancer journey.
        Ask what she wants and needs - and don't be afraid to ask her to share her feelings!</p>
</div>
<div class ="neuf">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-ear-listen" style="color: #cf569c;"></i></p>
    <h1>8.  Now more than ever tune into her needs. </h1>
    <p >Listen and look for "tell-tale" signs: Is she sleepy and doesn't want com-pany? Or vice versa, does she need an ear to vent or decompress? If so, don't try to solve her problems (or tell stories of your
        Uncle Joe's mother's friend's experience with breast cancer).
        Just listen!</p>
</div>
<div class ="dix">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-viruses" style="color: #eac49a;"></i>
    <h1>9. Get a mammogram!</h1>
    <p >Show your support for your friend by getting a screening yourself. Surely, she'll appreciate that you understand the importance of taking care of yourself - and encourage your friends and family to do the same.</p>
