          <span class="card__title">Now more than ever tune into her needs. </span>
          <p class="card__text">Listen and look for "tell-tale" signs: Is she sleepy and doesn't want com-pany? Or vice versa, does she need an ear to vent or decompress? If so, don't try to solve her problems (or tell stories of your Uncle Joe's mother's friend's experience with breast cancer). Just listen!</p>
